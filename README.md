## Introduction

Gold prices are influenced by multiple factors, including market demand, economic indicators, and geopolitical events. This project uses historical data and machine learning techniques to create a model that can predict future gold prices. The predictions can assist in making informed decisions in trading and investment.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the dataset, handling missing values and transforming features for optimal model performance.
- **Model Training:** Implements regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Networks to predict gold prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization:** Provides plots to analyze trends in gold prices and compare model predictions with actual values.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras (if Neural Networks are used)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
